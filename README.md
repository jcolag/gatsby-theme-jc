# gatsby-theme-jc

A custom "starter" for Gatsby that just happens to match my personal website, which is largely based on [wonism](https://github.com/wonism)'s [Gatsby advanced blog](https://github.com/wonism/gatsby-advanced-blog).  If you're looking to set up a blog, I _highly_ recommend starting there, rather than here.  The styling is more neutral and the license is more liberal.

```
$ npm i -S gatsby-advanced-blog
```

## Start with gatsby-cli
```
$ gatsby new PROJECT_NAME https://github.com/wonism/gatsby-advanced-blog
```
