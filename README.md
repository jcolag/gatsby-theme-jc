# gatsby-theme-jc

A custom "starter" for Gatsby that just happens to match my personal website, which is largely based on [wonism](https://github.com/wonism)'s [Gatsby advanced blog](https://github.com/wonism/gatsby-advanced-blog).  If you're looking to set up a blog, I _highly_ recommend starting there, rather than here.  The styling is more neutral, doesn't have any of my content, is available through the CLI, and is available under a more liberal license.

Or, given how much of my contact information is now embedded and how difficult it is to envision how I'm going to keep the actual blog content completely separate from the shell, maybe it's more the blog-to-be than a starter or template or theme.  Probably an even bigger reason for you to go back to the starter, if you're here...
